        iconColor: '#4caf50', // Green for health metrics
    },
    workouts: {
        background: 'linear-gradient(135deg, #fff3e0 0%, #ffe0b2 100%)',
        iconColor: '#ff9800', // Orange for workout activities
    },
    achievements: {
        background: 'linear-gradient(135deg, #f3e5f5 0%, #e1bee7 100%)',
        iconColor: '#9c27b0', // Purple for achievements
    },
    progress: {
        background: 'linear-gradient(135deg, #fce4ec 0%, #f8bbd9 100%)',
